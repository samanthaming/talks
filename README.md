# Samantha Ming's Talks

Here you will find the slides and resources for my talks.

## Invite Me To Speak 👩🏻‍🏫

I love sharing what I've learned. I've spoken at high schools, colleges, and tech companies. From my experience on how I grew my personal brand OR how I switched careers into tech without a CS degree OR how kindness has made me more successful. My goal is to bring value, motivate action, and inspire kindness in your audience.
